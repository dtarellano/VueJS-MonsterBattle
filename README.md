# vue-battle

> A Vue.js project.  This is a exercise built to put all the tings I have learned with VueJS so far. The HTML and CSS was pre built by Instructor. All the Javascript will be written by me.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
